Although D&X is high-\\nly controversial, some physicians argue that it has advan-\\ntages that make it a preferable procedure in some circum-\\nstances. One perceived advantage is that the fetus is\\nremoved largely intact, allowing for better evaluation and\\nautopsy of the fetus in cases of known fetal anomalies.\\nIntact removal of the fetus may also confer a lower risk\\nof puncturing the uterus or damaging the cervix. Another\\nperceived advantage is that D&X ends the pregnancy\\nwithout requiring the woman to go through labor, which\\nmay be less emotionally traumatic than other methods of\\nlate-term abortion. In addition, D&X may offer a lower\\ncost and shorter procedure time.\\nPrecautions\\nWomen considering D&X should be aware of the\\nhighly controversial nature of this procedure. A contro-\\nversy common to all late-term abortions is whether the\\nfetus is viable, or able to survive outside of the woman’s\\nbody. A specific area of controversy with D&X is that\\nfetal death does not occur until after most of the fetal\\nbody has exited the uterus. Several states have taken\\nlegal action to limit or ban D&X and many physicians\\nwho perform abortions do not perform D&X. This may\\nrestrict the availability of this procedure to women seek-\\ning late-term abortion.\\nDescription\\nIntact D&X, or partial birth abortion first involves\\nadministration of medications to cause the cervix to\\ndilate, usually over the course of several days. Next, the\\nphysician rotates the fetus to a footling breech position.\\nThe body of the fetus is then drawn out of the uterus feet\\nfirst, until only the head remains inside the uterus. Then,\\nthe physician uses an instrument to puncture the base of\\nthe skull, which collapses the fetal head. Typically, the\\ncontents of the fetal head are then partially suctioned out,\\nwhich results in the death of the fetus, and reduces the\\nsizes of the fetal head enough to allow it to pass through\\nthe cervix. The dead and otherwise intact fetus is then\\nremoved from the woman’s body.\\nPreparation\\nMedical preparation for D&X involves an outpatient\\nvisit to administer medications, such as laminaria ,t o\\ncause the cervix to begin dilating.\\nIn addition, preparation may involve fulfilling local\\nlegal requirements, such as a mandatory waiting period,\\ncounseling, or an informed consent procedure reviewing\\nstages of fetal development, childbirth, alternative abor-\\ntion methods, and adoption.\\nKEY TERMS\\nCervix—The narrow outer end of the uterus that\\nseparates the uterus from the vaginal canal.\\nFootling breech —A position of the fetus while in\\nthe uterus where the feet of the fetus are nearest\\nthe cervix would be the first part of the fetus to exit\\nthe uterus, with the head of the fetus being the last\\npart to exit the uterus.\\nLaminaria —A medical product made from a cer-\\ntain type of seaweed that is physically placed near\\nthe cervix to cause it to dilate.\\nAftercare\\nD&X typically does not require an overnight hospi-\\ntal stay, so a follow up appointment may be scheduled to\\nmonitor the woman for any complications.\\nRisks\\nWith all abortion, the later in pregnancy an abortion\\nis performed, the more complicated the procedure and\\nthe greater the risk of injury to the woman. In addition to\\nassociated emotion reactions, D&X carries the risk of\\ninjury to the woman, including heavy bleeding, blood\\nclots, damage to the cervix or uterus, pelvic infection,\\nand anesthesia-related complications. There is also a risk\\nof incomplete abortion, meaning that the fetus is not\\ndead when removed from the woman’s body. Possible\\nlong-term risks include difficulty becoming pregnant or\\ncarrying a future pregnancy to term.\\nNormal results\\nThe expected outcome of D&X is the termination of\\na pregnancy with removal of a dead fetus from the\\nwoman’s body.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\nEpner, Janet E., et al. “Late-term Abortion.”JAMA 280, no. 8\\n(26 August 1998): 724-729.\\nSprang, M.

Dugan, M.S.\\nAbortion, selective\\nDefinition\\nSelective abortion, also known as selective reduc-\\ntion, refers to choosing to abort a fetus, typically in a\\nmulti-fetal pregnancy, to decrease the health risks to the\\nmother in carrying and giving birth to more than one or\\ntwo babies, and also to decrease the risk of complications\\nto the remaining fetus(es). The term selective abortion\\nalso refers to choosing to abort a fetus for reasons such as\\nthe woman is carrying a fetus which likely will be born\\nwith some birth defect or impairment, or because the sex\\nof the fetus is not preferred by the individual.\\nPurpose\\nA woman may decide to abort for health reasons, for\\nexample, she is at higher risk for complications during preg-\\nnancy because of a disorder or disease such as diabetes.\\nHowever, selective reduction is recommended often in\\ncases of multi-fetal pregnancy, or the presence of more than\\none fetus, typically, at least three or more fetuses. In the\\ngeneral population, multi-fetal pregnancy happens in only\\nabout 1-2% of pregnant women. But multi-fetal pregnan-\\ncies occur far more often in women using fertility drugs.\\nPrecautions\\nBecause women or couples who use fertility drugs\\nhave made an extra effort to become pregnant, it is possi-\\nble that the individuals may be unwilling or uncomfort-\\nable with the decision to abort a fetus in cases of multi-\\nfetal pregnancy. Individuals engaging in fertility treat-\\nment should be made aware of the risk of multi-fetal\\npregnancy and consider the prospect of recommended\\nreduction before undergoing fertility treatment.\\nDescription\\nSelective reduction is usually performed between\\nnine and 12 weeks of pregnancy and is most successful\\nwhen performed in early pregnancy. It is a simple proce-\\ndure and can be performed on an outpatient basis. A nee-\\ndle is inserted into the woman’s stomach or vagina and\\npotassium chloride is injected into the fetus.\\nPreparation\\nIndividuals who have chosen selective reduction to\\nsafeguard the remaining fetuses should be counseled\\nprior to the procedure. Individuals should receive infor-\\nmation regarding the risks of a multi-fetal pregnancy to\\nboth the fetuses and the mother compared with the risks\\nafter the reduction.\\nIndividuals seeking an abortion for any reason\\nshould consider the ethical implications whether it be\\nbecause the fetus is not the preferred sex or because the\\nfetus would be born with a severe birth defect.\\nAftercare\\nCounseling should continue after the abortion\\nbecause it is a traumatic event. Individuals may feel\\nguilty about choosing one fetus over another. Mental\\nhealth professionals should be consulted throughout the\\nprocess.\\nRisks\\nAbout 75% of women who undergo selective reduc-\\ntion will go into premature labor . About 4-5% of\\nwomen undergoing selective reduction also miscarry one\\nor more of the remaining fetuses. The risks associated\\nwith multi-fetal pregnancy is considered higher.\\nNormal results\\nIn cases where a multi-fetal pregnancy, three or\\nmore fetuses, is reduced to two, the twin fetuses typically\\ndevelop as they would as if they were conceived as twins.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nKnobil, Ernst and Jimmy D.

Women\\nhave abortions because continuing the pregnancy would\\ncause them hardship, endanger their life or health, or\\nbecause prenatal testing has shown that the fetus will be\\nborn with severe abnormalities.\\nAbortions are safest when performed within the first\\nsix to 10 weeks after the last menstrual period. The cal-\\nculation of this date is referred to as the gestational age\\nand is used in determining the stage of pregnancy. For\\nexample, a woman who is two weeks late having her\\nperiod is said to be six weeks pregnant, because it is six\\nweeks since she last menstruated.\\nAbout 90% of women who have abortions do so\\nbefore 13 weeks and experience few complications.\\nAbortions performed between 13-24 weeks have a higher\\nKEY TERMS\\nMulti-fetal pregnancy —A pregnancy of two or\\nmore fetuses.\\nSelective reduction—Typically referred to in cases\\nof multifetal pregnancy, when one or more fetuses\\nare aborted to preserve the viability of the remain-\\ning fetuses and decrease health risks to the mother.\\nrate of complications. Abortions after 24 weeks are\\nextremely rare and are usually limited to situations where\\nthe life of the mother is in danger.\\nPrecautions\\nMost women are able to have abortions at clinics or\\noutpatient facilities if the procedure is performed early in\\npregnancy. Women who have stable diabetes, controlled\\nepilepsy, mild to moderate high blood pressure, or who\\nare HIV positive can often have abortions as outpatients\\nif precautions are taken. Women with heart disease, pre-\\nvious endocarditis, asthma, lupus erythematosus, uter-\\nine fibroid tumors, blood clotting disorders, poorly con-\\ntrolled epilepsy, or some psychological disorders usually\\nneed to be hospitalized in order to receive special moni-\\ntoring and medications during the procedure.\\nDescription\\nV ery early abortions\\nBetween five and seven weeks, a pregnancy can be\\nended by a procedure called menstrual extraction. This\\nprocedure is also sometimes called menstrual regulation,\\nmini-suction, or preemptive abortion. The contents of the\\nuterus are suctioned out through a thin (3-4 mm) plastic\\ntube that is inserted through the undilated cervix. Suction\\nis applied either by a bulb syringe or a small pump.\\nAnother method is called the “morning after” pill, or\\nemergency contraception . Basically, it involves taking\\nhigh doses of birth control pills within 24 to 48 hours of\\nhaving unprotected sex. The high doses of hormones\\ncauses the uterine lining to change so that it will not sup-\\nport a pregnancy. Thus, if the egg has been fertilized, it is\\nsimply expelled from the body.\\nThere are two types of emergency contraception.\\nOne type is identical to ordinary birth control pills, and\\nuses the hormones estrogen and progestin). This type is\\navailable with a prescription under the brand name Pre-\\nven. But women can even use their regular birth control\\npills for emergency contraception, after they check with\\ntheir doctor about the proper dose. About half of women\\nwho use birth control pills for emergency contraception\\nget nauseated and 20 percent vomit. This method cuts the\\nrisk of pregnancy 75 percent.\\nThe other type of morning-after pill contains only\\none hormone: progestin, and is available under the brand\\nname Plan B. It is more effective than the first type with\\na lower risk of nausea and vomiting. It reduces the risk\\nof pregnancy 89 percent.\\nWomen should check with their physicians regard-\\ning the proper dose of pills to take, as it depends on the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 9\\nAbortion, therapeutic\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 9'),\n",

Not all birth control pills will\\nwork for emergency contraception.\\nMenstrual extractions are safe, but because the\\namount of fetal material is so small at this stage of devel-\\nopment, it is easy to miss. This results in an incomplete\\nabortion that means the pregnancy continues.\\nFirst trimester abortions\\nThe first trimester of pregnancy includes the first 13\\nweeks after the last menstrual period. In the United\\nStates, about 90% of abortions are performed during this\\nperiod. It is the safest time in which to have an abortion,\\nand the time in which women have the most choice of\\nhow the procedure is performed.\\nMEDICAL ABORTIONS. Medical abortions are brought\\nabout by taking medications that end the pregnancy. The\\nadvantages of a first trimester medical abortion are:\\n• The procedure is non-invasive; no surgical instruments\\nare used.\\n• Anesthesia is not required.\\n• Drugs are administered either orally or by injection.\\n• The procedure resembles a natural miscarriage.\\nDisadvantages of a medical abortion are:\\n• The effectiveness decreases after the seventh week.\\n• The procedure may require multiple visits to the doctor.\\n• Bleeding after the abortion lasts longer than after a sur-\\ngical abortion.\\n• The woman may see the contents of her womb as it is\\nexpelled.\\nTwo different medications can be used to bring about\\nan abortion. Methotrexate (Rheumatrex) works by stop-\\nping fetal cells from dividing which causes the fetus to die.\\nOn the first visit to the doctor, the woman receives\\nan injection of methotrexate. On the second visit, about\\na week later, she is given misoprostol (Cytotec), an\\noxygenated unsaturated cyclic fatty acid responsible for\\nvarious hormonal reactions such as muscle contraction\\n(prostaglandin), that stimulates contractions of the\\nuterus. Within two weeks, the woman will expel the\\ncontents of her uterus, ending the pregnancy. A follow-\\nup visit to the doctor is necessary to assure that the\\nabortion is complete.\\nWith this procedure, a woman will feel cramping\\nand may feel nauseated from the misoprostol. This\\ncombination of drugs is 90-96% effective in ending\\npregnancy.\\nMifepristone (RU-486), which goes by the brand\\nname Mifeprex, works by blocking the action of prog-\\nesterone, a hormone needed for pregnancy to continue,\\nthen stimulates uterine contractions thus ending the\\npregnancy. It can be taken a much as 49 days after the\\nfirst day of a woman’s last period. On the first visit to\\nthe doctor, a woman takes a mifepristone pill. Two days\\nlater she returns and, if the miscarriage has not\\noccurred, takes two misoprostol pills, which causes the\\nuterus to contract. Five percent of women won’t need to\\ntake misoprostol.

The procedure is also called\\ndilation and evacuation (D & E), suction dilation, vacu-\\num curettage, or suction curettage.\\nAdvantages of a vacuum aspiration abortion are:\\n• It is usually done as a one-day outpatient procedure.\\n• The procedure takes only 10-15 minutes.\\n• Bleeding after the abortion lasts five days or less.\\n• The woman does not see the products of her womb\\nbeing removed.\\nDisadvantages include:\\n• The procedure is invasive; surgical instruments are used.\\n• Infection may occur.\\nDuring a vacuum aspiration, the woman’s cervix is\\ngradually dilated by expanding rods inserted into the\\ncervical opening. Once dilated, a tube attached to a suc-\\ntion pump is inserted through the cervix and the con-\\ntents of the uterus are suctioned out. The procedure is\\n97-99% effective. The amount of discomfort a woman\\nfeels varies considerably. Local anesthesia is often\\ngiven to numb the cervix, but it does not mask uterine\\ncramping. After a few hours of rest, the woman may\\nreturn home.\\nSecond trimester abortions\\nAlthough it is better to have an abortion during the\\nfirst trimester, some second trimester abortions may be\\ninevitable. The results of genetic testing are often not\\navailable until 16 weeks. In addition, women, especially\\nteens, may not have recognized the pregnancy or come to\\nterms with it emotionally soon enough to have a first\\ntrimester abortion. Teens make up the largest group hav-\\ning second trimester abortions.\\nSome second trimester abortions are performed as a\\nD & E. The procedures are similar to those used in the\\nfirst trimester, but a larger suction tube must be used\\nbecause more material must be removed. This increases\\nthe amount of cervical dilation necessary and increases\\nthe risk of the procedure. Many physicians are reluctant\\nto perform a D & E this late in pregnancy, and for some\\nwomen is it not a medically safe option.\\nThe alternative to a D & E in the second trimester is\\nan abortion by induced labor. Induced labor may require\\nan overnight stay in a hospital. The day before the proce-\\ndure, the woman visits the doctor for tests, and to either\\nKEY TERMS\\nEndocarditis —An infection of the inner mem-\\nbrane lining of the heart.\\nFibroid tumors —Fibroid tumors are non-cancer-\\nous (benign) growths in the uterus.
